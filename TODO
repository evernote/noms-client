* Documentation of libraries and how to use
* Make use of --fields and --format and stuff
  more clear in documentation
* shortcut options for common use cases (like
  --short for tighter output without column headings)
* Complex requests for NCC API
* Factor almost all of CLI into interface library (in particular,
  waitfor)

* need a way for the docs/help/usage to be additive from library. 
  i.e. library has new functions, docs/help/usage for how to use 
  them, should be displayed in noms --help
